    <h1>PolyRest</h1>

    <p>Perhaps analagous to PHPMyAdmin for MySQL, or to a lesser degree - Ruby on Rails or Grails, PolyRest asks the
      question <strong><em>"What can I do with HATEOAS REST APIs,
        without writing any table-specific code, and using Polymer as a front end for the Javascript?"</em></strong></p>

    <p>The code for this app is <a
      href="https://github.com/datafundamentals/polyrest">here</a> If
      nothing else,
      you can use some of the code as sample Polymer code for your own app.</p>

    <p>PolyRest is a technical proof of concept ONLY, and not intended as production code in it's
      current (or future?) form.</p>
    <h4>Please! Do not hold Polymer responsible for...</h4>

    <p>...for the poor execution of visuals
      on this technical POC. Polymer has great visual capabilities, the author of this POC does not. :(</p>

    <h2>Pairing with Spring Data Rest and Spring Boot - back end option:</h2>

    <p>Need your own data feed? Spend a day and knock out a big, pre-populated REST API set, like the <a
      href="http://172.99.79.10:8156/">12 REST API samples</a>
      or, the code <a
        href="https://bitbucket.org/datafundamentals/smoslt.data">here</a>. Yes, a day should be sufficient, once
      you learn that system. It's pretty easy, at least if you are a <em>[yawn]</em> conventional corporate java developer.</p>

    <p>Then use this tool for basic CRUD operations on your new API</p>

    <p>You now have working CRUD for your basic data set, and you still haven't made a dent in your development budget!
      Yeah! Focus your efforts on the value-adds that really matter, not just getting the basic CRUD
      operations working.</p>

    <h1>TO DO:</h1>

    <p>The TO DO list is shown below, as if there was an intent to complete it. Any assumption that this is the case,
      and that <em>'someone'</em> actually intends to do so, may be purely imaginary.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>There seems to be stale artifacts coming from somewhere that pollute or confused jsonObject generally. Or
        something.
      </li>
      <li>Publish out to polyrest.datafundamentals.com
      </li>
      <li>Make rest of links and buttons, and have them actually work. Like, delete for example</li>
      <li>On start screen make base link an input that you can change.</li>
      <li>Continue cleanup</li>
      <li>Fix title divs all</li>
      <li>Add toggle on-off button to jsonString</li>
      <li>For item view, true/false into checkbox</li>
      <li>Add cutesy stuff like colors title etc</li>
      <li>Deploy on rackspace carina or dreamhost or both</li>
      <li>Wrap view and other list elements in tables to make them more visually pleasing</li>
      <li>Wrap footer elements in tables to make them more visually pleasing</li>
      <li>Need more REST APIs to call from than just this one</li>
      <li>Need to test with other apis that this was not designed for - more as a curiosity.</li>
      <li>Need to re-work sample REST APIs to use random words and not random text to yeild a more realistic use case
      </li>
      <li>Might be nice if something beyond happy-path was coded for in this app</li>
      <li>Need to go back and write tests for everything done so far</li>
      <li>Need to add capability to specify other than GET calls</li>
      <li>Need to add capability to specify params as required? Or not? Not familiar enough with clean-url hateoas
        design to know.
      </li>
      <li>Make search and refresh icons do something or get rid of them (on banner top right)</li>
      <li>Add an incoming page for inputting the base url, instead of just hardcoding to one, or typing in the browser
        url.
      </li>
      <li>Rename consumer page as "sample" for inputting the base url, instead of just hardcoding to one, or typing in
        the browser url.
      </li>
      <li>Test off-line to see what does and does not work? 12th of never, because requires https</li>
      <li>Test copypasting generated source html and see how much of it is consumable directly</li>
      <li>Hardcoded to add http:/ if given none, what if needs to add https?</li>
      <li>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Anything like css, or prettying up this app for visual features, is not even contemplated. Pull requests welcome, if it bugs you to ave the visuals suck</p>
